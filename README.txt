At the current phase, the majority of the backbone of
the website is set up. There are a few examples
of different html files that showcase some part of
the website.

The main index/detail.html page is very minimal and does
not properly showcase any html abilities. This is also
similar to the other html pages. This project only showcases
the use of django routines to enhance the python and website
handling.
